We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will ensure to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues.**

Instead please use the [advisory feature](https://github.com/heutelbeck/sapl-policy-engine/security/advisories) to report security vulnerabilities. This enables us to triage and resolve critical vulnerabilities before disclosing them to the public.

If you're unable to use this feature you can send a mail to <dominic@heutelbeck.com>.

We strive to acknowledge each report in less than 5 business days. The time it takes to resolve a report depends on the specifics of the vulnerability.
