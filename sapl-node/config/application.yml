#
# This configuration file is loaded by the SAPL Node, if run from source using 
# the 'mvn spring-boot:run' command in your terminal from the sapl-node folder.
# In this situation, the server looks for configuration in the sub folder 'security'
# relative to the folder from where it has been startet.
#
# This is a demo configuration. As it contains some specific credentials, it must 
# not be reused in a production environment.
# 
# This configuration sets up the server to vocal logging, so that for learning SAPL, 
# it is easy to follow what the PDP Server does.
#

#
# The SAPL Node does not have a dedicated administration interface. 
# Administration of the service is done by editing configuration files.
#

#
# Client Authentication
# 

#
# The server supports four different modes for authentication for clients 
# attempting to perform authorizations via the server:
#
# - No authentication: In this case the server does not ask for any 
#                      authentication to be present before answering 
#                      requests or subscriptions.
#   
#   This mode has primary use-cases:
#    * testing and development
#    * deployments where authentication of APIs is delegated to API 
#      gateways, k8s ingress services or simmilar situations.
#
#   WARNING: Do not use this option in production if access is not 
#            mitigated by such services. In any case this option will
#            open up the server for malicious probing and exfiltration 
#            attepts via the authorization endpoints, potentially 
#            (depending on your policies) leading to unaothorized
#            access to your organization's data.
#  
# This option is controlled by the property io.sapl.node.allowNoAuth
# which can be set to True or False.
#
io.sapl:
  node:
    # true|false If true, allow access to the PDP API without authentication.
    allowNoAuth: false

    # true|false If true, allow access to the PDP API via Basic Authentication.
    # Credentials are configured per-user in the users list below.
    allowBasicAuth: true

    # true|false If true, allow access to the PDP API via API key Bearer tokens.
    # API keys are configured per-user in the users list below.
    allowApiKeyAuth: true

    # true|false If true, allow access to the PDP API via OAuth2 JWT Bearer tokens.
    allowOauth2Auth: false

    # Global PDP ID settings (applies to all auth methods: Basic, API Key, OAuth2)
    # If true, reject authentication when pdpId is missing from user config or JWT claim.
    # If false, use defaultPdpId as fallback.
    rejectOnMissingPdpId: false

    #
    # Unified User Management
    #
    # Each user entry defines a client that can authenticate to the PDP.
    # Users can authenticate via Basic Auth OR API Key (not both).
    # Each user is associated with a pdpId for multi-tenant PDP routing.
    #
    users:
      #
      # Basic Authentication User
      #
      # Use case: Developers prefer Basic Auth as most HTTP clients support it natively.
      # Advantage: Secret is not stored as plain text (Argon2 hashed).
      # Disadvantage: Authentication per request is costly (latency).
      #
      # For this user, the following HTTP Header is valid:
      # Authorization: Basic eHd1VWFSRDY1Rzozal9QSzcxYmp5IWhOMyp4cS54WnF2ZVUpdDVoS0xSXw==
      #
      - id: "demo-basic-client"

      #
      # API Key Authentication Users
      #
      # Use case: Multiple clients with high traffic and low latency requirements.
      # Advantage: Low latency, lightweight verification.
      # Disadvantage: API keys must be securely distributed to clients.
      #
      # Clients authenticate with: Authorization: Bearer <api-key>

    # To generate new credentials, run:

    # java -jar sapl-node-3.0.0.jar generate --api-key --id "my-client" --pdp-id "staging"
    #

#
# OAuth2 Resource Server Configuration
#
# Use Case: Your organization uses an OAuth2 authorization server for managing API access.
# Advantage: Low latency, light cryptography per request.
# Disadvantage: Requires additional infrastructure (OAuth2 authorization server).
#
# When allowOauth2Auth is true, configure the JWT issuer below.
# The pdpId can be extracted from a JWT claim (configured in oauth.pdpIdClaim above).
#
# Setup Spring OAuth2 Resource Server.
# Also refer to: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/resource-server/jwt.html
# Uncomment and set the issuer URI when allowOauth2Auth is true:
# spring.security.oauth2:
#       resourceserver:
#          jwt.issuer-uri: https://your-auth-server/realms/your-realm

#
# Setup paths for PDP configuration and SAPL documents. I.e. policies and policy sets.
#
io.sapl.pdp.embedded:
      config-path: ~/sapl    # The server expects a pdp.json file in this folder
      policies-path: ~/sapl  # The server will monitor this folder for *.sapl files

#
# The following options enable or disable different levels of logging for decisions.
#
# print-trace: true|false This is the most fine-grained explanation of a decision made
#                         by the PDP each individual calculation step is documented.
#                         The trace is in JSON format and may become very large.
#                         Recommended only as a last resort for troubleshooting.
      print-trace: false
# print-json-report: true|false This is a JSON report summarizing the applied algorithms
#                               and results of each evaluated policy (set) in the
#                               decision-making process. It includes lists of all errors and values
#                               of policy information point attributes encountered
#                               during the evaluation of each policy (set).
      print-json-report: false
# print-text-report: true|false This will log a human-readable textual report based on the
#                               same data as the 'print-json-report' option generates.
      print-text-report: false
# pretty-print-reports: true|false This option can enable formatting of JSON data while
#                                  printing JSON during reporting and tracing.
      pretty-print-reports: false

#
# Side loading of SAPL extensions
#
# It is possible to add libraries and PIPs to the SAPL Node
#
# SAPL Node uses the Spring Boot Properties Launcher.
#
# Please refer to: 
# https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/executable-jar.html#appendix.executable-jar.launching
#
# A comma-separated list of directories can be set in loader.path. 
# Here the server will pick up additional JARs and if the contained beans are in a sub package of 
# 'io.sapl.server', or if the JARs are instrumented with the matching Spring autoconfiguration,
# the libraries and PIPs will be loaded at startup.
#   
# loader.path: /pdp/data/lib
#

# 
# General server settings
#
# SAPL Node uses the Spring Boot mechanisms to set up the server name, address, TLS etc.
# 
# Please refer to: 
# https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto.properties-and-configuration
# https://spring.io/blog/2023/06/07/securing-spring-boot-applications-with-ssl/
#
# The demo configuration below uses a simple self-signed certificate for TLS on localhost.
#
# SSL is activated by default and the server will fail to start up when no certificate information is provided, 
# or TLS is explicitly deactivated.
#
server:
   address: localhost
   port: 8080
   ssl:
      enabled: false
#      key-store-type: PKCS12
#      key-store: file:security/keystore.p12
#      key-store-password: changeme
#      key-password: changeme
#      key-alias: netty

# Set the time between keep-alive frames in seconds. These messages are required to avoid that an inactive tcp connection
# is dropped by a firewall or other network components. The default vlaue 0 disables keep-alive messages.
# io.sapl.node.keep-alive: 15
