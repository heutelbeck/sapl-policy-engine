## Functions

SAPL ships with a set of standard function libraries. Functions are pure, synchronous computations that can be used in any SAPL expression, including target expressions. For the conceptual model, properties, and how functions differ from attribute finders, see [Functions and Attribute Finders](../2_8_FunctionsAndAttributes/).

The following pages document each built-in function library.
