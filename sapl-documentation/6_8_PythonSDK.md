## Python SDK

The SAPL Python SDK provides a client for connecting Python applications to a SAPL PDP server via the HTTP API.

> **Planned content.** This SDK is maintained in a separate repository and requires validation against SAPL 4.0. This page will be populated once the SDK is updated and verified.
