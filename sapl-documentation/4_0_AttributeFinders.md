## Attribute Finders

SAPL ships with a set of built-in Policy Information Points (PIPs) that provide attribute finders for common authorization needs. Attribute finders access external, potentially streaming data sources during policy evaluation. For the conceptual model, streaming behavior, parameters, options, and the attribute broker, see [Functions and Attribute Finders](../2_7_FunctionsAndAttributes/).

The following pages document each built-in PIP library.
