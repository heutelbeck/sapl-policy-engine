## Performance

This section will document performance characteristics and optimization strategies for SAPL deployments.

### Planned Topics

- **Automatic indexing:** How the PDP indexes policies for fast matching and what policy structures optimize index effectiveness
- **Policy structure impact:** How policy organization affects evaluation performance (cross-reference to [SAPL Expressions](../5_7_SAPLExpressions/) for cost-stratified evaluation)
- **Profiling and benchmarking:** Tools and techniques for measuring PDP performance
- **Scaling strategies:** Horizontal and vertical scaling considerations for SAPL Node deployments

> **Planned content.** This page will be expanded with benchmarks, tuning guides, and architecture recommendations.
