## C# / .NET SDK

The SAPL .NET SDK provides a client for connecting C# and .NET applications to a SAPL PDP server via the HTTP API.

> **Planned content.** This SDK is maintained in a separate repository and requires validation against SAPL 4.0. This page will be populated once the SDK is updated and verified.
