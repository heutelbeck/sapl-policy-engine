## Errors and Troubleshooting

This section will provide an error catalog and troubleshooting guide for SAPL.

### Planned Topics

- **Error catalog by stage:** Parse errors, compilation errors, and evaluation errors with explanations and fixes
- **Common mistakes and solutions:** Frequently encountered issues and their resolutions
- **Silent failures:** Issues that do not produce errors but lead to unexpected behavior (e.g., using identifiers that look like keywords)
- **Diagnostic tools:** Using `TRACE` and `REPORT` logging to debug policy evaluation

> **Planned content.** This page will be expanded with a searchable error reference and worked troubleshooting examples.
