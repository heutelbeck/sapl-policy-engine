## Additional SDKs

This page will track additional language SDKs as they become available.

Any programming language that can make HTTP requests and parse JSON can integrate with SAPL via the [HTTP API](../4_2_HTTPServer-SentEventsAPI/). Language-specific SDKs provide idiomatic wrappers, streaming support, and type-safe interfaces for their respective ecosystems.

> **Planned content.** Additional SDKs will be documented here as they are developed.
