/**
 * The @EnforceRecoverableIfDenied annotation establishes a reactive policy
 * enforcement point (PEP). The PEP is only applicable to methods returning a
 * {@link org.reactivestreams.Publisher Publisher}, i.e., a
 * {@link reactor.core.publisher.Flux Flux} or a
 * {@link reactor.core.publisher.Mono Mono}.
 * <p>
 * The publisher returned by the method is wrapped by the PEP. The PEP starts
 * processing, i.e, sending a subscription to the PDP, upon subscription time.
 * <p>
 * The established PEP also wires in matching handlers for obligations and
 * advice into the matching signal paths of the publisher.
 * <p>
 * Subscribe to the resource after the first decision, make it a hot source.
 * Filter out all events from the data stream wile the most recent decision is
 * not PERMIT. However, on a non-permit signal an AccessDeniedException
 * downstream. Enable the client to recover and wait for the resource to become
 * available again.
 * <p>
 * Keep the subscription alive as long as the client does.
 * <p>
 * The client is aware of access denied events.
 * <p>
 *
 * The parameters subject, action, resource, and environment can be used to
 * explicitly set the corresponding keys in the SAPL authorization subscription,
 * assuming that the Spring context and ObjectMapper are configured to be able
 * to serialize the resulting value into JSON.
