## Embedded SAPL Policy Decision Point (PDP)

This module implements the PDP API. This implements only the PDP itself, without any support for writing Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). PEPs are implemented in their respective framework integration modules for the specific framework (e.g., Spring Boot, Axon, Vaadin).
