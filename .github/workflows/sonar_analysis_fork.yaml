# This workflow allows for analyzing pull requests from forks with SonarCloud. Since
# SonarCloud analysis requires a SonarCloud token in the form of a repository secret
# and workflows triggered by pull requests from a fork do not have access to these
# secrets, this workaround is needed. Information and files needed for a SonarCloud
# analysis are downloaded as an artifact from a previous build workflow.
# This workflow is always triggered by the conclusion of the build workflow but is skipped
# if the previous workflow was not triggered by a fork or failed.
