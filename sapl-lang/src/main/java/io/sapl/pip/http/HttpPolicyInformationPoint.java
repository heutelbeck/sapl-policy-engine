    public static final String DESCRIPTION = """
            This Policy Information Point provided basic means to source attribute data by consuming
            HTTP-based APIs and Websockets.

            The Attributes are named according to the HTTP verb, i.e., get, put, delete, post, and patch.
            And are available as either environment attributes or attributes of a an URL which semantically
            identifies a resource used as the left-hand input parameter of the attribute finders.

            This PIP is more technical than domain driven and therefore the attributes are specified by
            defining HTTP requests by defining a ```requestSetings``` object, which may contain the following
            parameters:
            * ```baseUrl```: The starting URL to build the request path.
            * ```path```: Path components to be appended to the baseUrl.
            * ```urlParameters```: An object with key-value pairs representing the HTTP query parameters to
            be embedded in the request URL.
            * ```headers```: An object with key-value pairs representing the HTTP headers.
            * ```body```: The request body.
            * ```accept```: The accepted mime media type.
            * ```contentType```: The mime type of the request body.
            * ```pollingIntervalMs```: The number of milliseconds between polling the HTTP endpoint. Defaults to 1000ms.
            * ```repetitions```: Upper bound for number of repeated requests. Defaults to 0x7fffffffffffffffL.

            For the media type ```text/event-stream```, the attribute finder will treat the consumed
            endpoint to be sending server-sent events (SSEs) and will not poll the endpoint, but subscribe
            to the events emitted by the consumed API.

            If the accepted media type is ```application/json```, the PIP will attempt to parse it and map
            the response body to a SAPL value. Else, the response body is returned as a text value.

            Example:
            ```
            {
              "baseUrl": "https://example.com",
              "path": "/api/owners",
