#
# This configuration file is loaded by the SAPL Server LT, if run from source using 
# the 'mvn spring-boot:run' command in your terminal from the sapl-server-lt folder.
# In this situation, the server looks for configuration in the sub folder 'config'
# relative to the folder from where it has been startet.
#
# This is a demo configuration. As it contains some specific credentials, it must 
# not be reused in a production environment.
# 
# This configuration sets up the server to vocal logging, so that for learning SAPL, 
# it is easy to follow what the PDP Server does.
#

#
# The SAPL Server LT does not have a dedicated administration interface. 
# Administration of the service is done by editing configuration files.
#

#
# Client Authentication
# 

#
# The server supports four different modes for authentication for clients 
# attempting to perform authorizations via the server:
#
# - No authentication: In this case the server does not ask for any 
#                      authentication to be present before answering 
#                      requests or subscriptions.
#   
#   This mode has primary use-cases:
#    * testing and development
#    * deployments where authentication of APIs is delegated to API 
#      gateways, k8s ingress services or simmilar situations.
#
#   WARNING: Do not use this option in production if access is not 
#            mitigated by such services. In any case this option will
#            open up the server for malicious probing and exfiltration 
#            attepts via the authorization endpoints, potentially 
#            (depending on your policies) leading to unaothorized 
#            access to your organizations data.
#  
# This option is controlled by the property io.sapl.server-lt.allowNoAuth
# which can be set to True or False.
#
io.sapl:
  server-lt:
    # true|false If true, allow access to the PDP API without authentication.
    allowNoAuth: false 

# - Basic Autentication (RFC 7617): This mode allows the registration of a 
#                                   single client application.
#
# Use case: The developers of the clients prefer this authentication method. 
#           For example most HTTP client libraries support basic authentication 
#           out of the box
#
# Advantage:    The secret is not stored as plain text.
#
# Disadvantage: Authentication per request/subscription is costly and introduces 
#               significant latency.  
#
# This option is controlled by the property io.sapl.server-lt.allowBasicAuth
# which can be set to true or false.
#  
    # true|false If true, allow access to the PDP API whenever a client authenticates using 
    # Basic Authentication with the credentials configured in the following properties.
    allowBasicAuth: true 
    # the io.sapl.server-lt.key property is the 'username' to be used in Basic Authentication
    key: xwuUaRD65G
    # the io.sapl.server-lt.secret property is the 'password' to be used in Basic Authentication
    # SAPL Server expects the secret to be encoded with Argon2
    # secret plaintext: 3j_PK71bjy!hN3*xq.xZqveU)t5hKLR_
    secret: $argon2id$v=19$m=16384,t=2,p=1$sNTVjma/BQZb5dzyIVCS3Q$c1Cy8OfyiEar4iv3Soxycc2jaOTJy6vV7gcMm+/jSRY
    # For the above example configuration the following HTTP Header would be a valid authentication:
    #
    # Authorization: Basic eHd1VWFSRDY1Rzozal9QSzcxYmp5IWhOMyp4cS54WnF2ZVUpdDVoS0xSXw==
    #
    # There are various command line tools to hash a password with Argon2. 
    # The server also comes with an utility to create credentials for Basic Authentication
    #
    # Run: java -jar sapl-server-lt-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -basicCredentials
    #
    # This will generate a reasonably secure key and secret, encode the secret using Argon2 and print it to the console.
    # Doing so will not start up an instance of the server.
    #

# - Authentication with API keys:
#
# Use Case: Managing multiple clients with high traffic and low latency requirements.
#
# Clients will get an API key assigned and authenticate by providing the following HTTP header:
#
# API_KEY: <API KEY>
#
# Example:
#
# API_KEY: phsNZdvQAFX9P2jgGzq9TrzUecQhsnHc
#
# Advantage:    Low latency, no cryptography per request necessary.
#
# Disadvantage: Credentials are stored in plain text on the server.  
#
    # true|false If true, allow access to the PDP API whenever a client authenticates using 
    # am API_KEY header.
    allowApiKeyAuth: false
    # list of API keys
    allowedApiKeys:
      - phsNZdvQAFX9P2jgGzq9TrzUecQhsnHh
      - uQKyuL3LkBY84hJXLFPgF6cATCsTYGgy

# - Authentication with OAuth2 and JWT 
#
# Use Case: Your organization uses an OAuth2 authorization server for managing API access already.
#
# Advantage:    Low latency, light cryptography per request necessary.
#
# Disadvantage: Need for additional infrastructure, i.e., that OAuth2 authorization server. 
#               More complex authentication process for client application.  
#
    # true|false If true, allow access to the PDP API whenever a client authenticates using 
    # am API_KEY header.
    allowOauth2Auth: false
# Setup Spring OAuth2 Resource Server.
# Also refer to: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/resource-server/jwt.html 
spring.security.oauth2:
      resourceserver:
         jwt.issuer-uri: http://auth-server:9000

#
# Setup paths for PDP configuration and SAPL documents. I.e. policies and policy sets.
#
io.sapl.pdp.embedded:
      config-path: ~/sapl    # The server expects a pdp.json file in this folder
      policies-path: ~/sapl  # The server will monitor this folder for *.sapl files

#
# The following options enable or disable different levels of logging for decisions.
#
# print-trace: true|false This is the most fine-grained explanation of a decision made
#                         by the PDP each individual calculation step is documented.
#                         The trace is in JSON format and may become very large.
#                         Recommended only as a last resort for troubleshooting.
      print-trace: true
# print-json-report: true|false This is a JSON report summarizing the applied algorithms
#                               and results of each evaluated policy (set) in the
#                               decision-making process. It includes lists of all errors and values
#                               of policy information point attributes encountered
#                               during the evaluation of each policy (set).
      print-json-report: true
# print-text-report: true|false This will log a human-readable textual report based on the
#                               same data as the 'print-json-report' option generates.
      print-text-report: true
# pretty-print-reports: true|false This option can enable formatting of JSON data while
#                                  printing JSON during reporting and tracing.
      pretty-print-reports: false

# Side loading of SAPL extensions
#
# It is possible to add libraries and PIPs to the SAPL Server LT
#
# SAPL Server LT uses the Spring Boot Properties Launcher.
#
# Please refer to: 
# https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/executable-jar.html#appendix.executable-jar.launching
#
# A comma-separated list of directories can be set in loader.path. 
# Here the server will pick up additional JARs and if the contained beans are in a sub package of 
# 'io.sapl.server', or if the JARs are instrumented with the matching Spring auto configuration,
# the libraries amd PIPs will be loaded at startup.
#   
# loader.path: /pdp/data/lib
#

# 
# General server settings
#
# SAPL Server LT uses the Spring Boot mechanisms to set up the server name, address, TLS etc.

#
# SSL is activated by default and the server will fail to start up when no certificate information is provided, 
# or TLS is explicitly deactivated.
